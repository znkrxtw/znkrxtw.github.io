                <h5>How to Play</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type a word into the input box and press Enter or the Guess button.</li>
                    <li>All occurrences of that word will become unredacted in the article body.</li>
                    <li>To win, figure out the title or subject of the article.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Tips and Quirks</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each guess must be one word only (Guessing multiple words at a time will not work).</li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Most</i> Punctuation is automatically
                        revealed in the article page. Some punctuation occasionally escapes
                        Redactle's filter and becomes redacted.
                    </li>
                    <li>Guesses are case-<i>insensitive</i>, and letters with diacritics (é, ü, etc.) are
                        considered
                        to not have those diacritics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shift+Enter will attempt to automatically
                        pluralize or singularize your guess. There are certain edge cases (e.g.
                        guessing a nonsense word like "asdf") where this will submit nonsense
                        guesses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will likely encounter some formatting and
                        punctuation quirks. These are a result of stripping away certain
                        characters and elements present in the original Wikipedia article that
                        don't play nicely with Redactle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many common words are automatically revealed for
                        your convenience. The list includes most English prepositions and
                        articles. Guessing these words does not count toward your score.
                    </li>
                    <li>Check the Settings menu for configuration options.</li>
